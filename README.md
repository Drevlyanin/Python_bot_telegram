This is a Python Telegram bot that is still in development. The bot is built using the telebot and webbrowser libraries. The telebot library is used to connect to the Telegram API and handle user messages. The webbrowser library is used to open a website when a user types the "site" or "website" command.

The bot has three main functions:

To respond with a greeting message when the user sends the "start", "main", or "hello" command.
To open a specific website when the user sends the "site" or "website" command.
To respond with the user's ID when the user sends the "id" command.
To use this bot, you will need to create a Telegram bot and obtain an API token. Replace the empty string '' on line 4 with your API token.

Note that this bot is still in development and may not have full functionality yet.
